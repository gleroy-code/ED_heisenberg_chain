First read the pdf file called "gabin_LEROY_TPIV_summer.pdf".


The file called "TPIV_spyder.py" and "TPIV_spyder_GS.py" are the codes that use the Young Tableau method to exact diagonalize the Heisenberg hamiltonian with one quark per site.
  - To obtain the full spectrum of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the chain with one quark per site, open the file called "TPIV_spyder.py".
  - To obtain only the ground state energy of the heisenberg hamiltonian on the chain with one quark per site, open the file called "TPIV_spyder_GS.py"

The file called "TPIV.py" is the code that uses the Cartan-subalgebra to exact diagonalize the Heisenberg hamiltonian with one quark per site and it returns the full spectrum.
